# ez-chat client
This is a chat app created to play with node, react and socket.io. Right now it's in a very primitive stage, but I'll be working on it a little bit. To try the app you can open different tabs and see how the chat messages are broadcasted to all the other tabs. You can also acces the app with your phone or any other device, and you'll see how the messages are also received there.

## Commits
Two emojis are used to describe te general purpose of the commits:

‚ûï: Add/create/implement a new feature

üîÑ: Refactor/small update/fix existing features

üÜï: Extra emoji that was used only in the first commit of the development

## Progress
- [x] Create the hello world
- [ ] Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects
- [ ] Add support for nicknames
- [ ] Don‚Äôt send the same message to the user that sent it. Instead, append the message directly as soon as he/she presses enter
- [ ] Add ‚Äú{user} is typing‚Äù functionality
- [ ] Show who‚Äôs online
- [ ] Add private messaging

This is the plan I'm following. This is basically the "Homework" from [Socket.io Getting started page](https://socket.io/get-started/chat#Homework). It looked really interesting so why not going for it!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
